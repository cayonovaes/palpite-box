## Palpite-Box

 - Project developed by me, along with Devpleno's FullStack Master training.
 - The project is based on a website where the customer of a particular 'Store X', has access to information about the establishment in question, and can give ratings, criticisms and praise, soon after the opinion about 'Store X' the customers received a coupon discount.
 - Those responsible for 'Loja X' will have access to this information in real time through a google spreadsheet.
